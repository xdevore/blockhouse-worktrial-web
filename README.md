I used the following tools for this project:
Stack overflow
Chatgpt for help with the chartjs library and css specifics
Django forum

For this project, I relied heavily on my experience building API's with Node Express, frontend design skills, and problem solving skills in figuring out Nextjs and Django, two frameworks that I'd never used before. I decided to start with the backend so that I would have data to work with as I began to work on the frontend. This was fun and challenging, as I had never previously used Django. I especially appreciated the opportunity to learn about views and models in API building in Django. Next, I outlined the frontend design - I knew I was going to have four charts, and I wanted to organized them in a 2x2 grid. Lastly, I connected to the backend using a simple fetch in my page.js file on the frontend and built out the frontend. Thank you so much for this opportunity!
